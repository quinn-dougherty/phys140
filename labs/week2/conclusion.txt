This week's experiment was about how measurement errors persist through calculation, and about how this is ok because error itself can be measured. We took measurements with instruments, which are flawed (sourcing some error) and watched as those errors propagated through the mathematical formulas to the final results. I'm learning through this experiment that error can be measured as a percentage, my conclusion is that it's ok that our instruments are imperfect because we can impose bounds on the results of the imperfections, since we know that the percent error will be low.
